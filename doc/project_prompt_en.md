# Snake Game Project Requirements

**语言/Language:**

- [中文](project_prompt.md)
- [English](project_prompt_en.md)

## Project Overview

Create a Snake game based on C language, using the ncurses library to implement a console interface.

## Core Functional Requirements

1. **Game Rules**:

   - Use arrow keys or WASD keys to control the snake's movement direction
   - The snake grows longer and score increases when eating food (\*)
   - Game ends when the snake hits the boundary or its own body
   - Press Q to exit the game

2. **Game Features**:

   - Support Chinese display, resolve text garbled issues
   - Clearly distinguish between snake head and body
   - Maintain consistent movement speed in all directions
   - Display final score when game ends

3. **Build System**:

   - Use CMake as the build tool
   - Ensure no redundant files are left in the root directory during compilation
   - Intermediate files should be placed in build directory
   - Executable files should be placed in bin directory

4. **Documentation Requirements**:

   - Clear README.md file, including game rules, compilation and running instructions, and file structure
   - Add appropriate badges to display project information (language, library, build tools, platforms)
   - Explain that the project was AI-assisted generated

5. **Testing Requirements**:

   - Write unit tests to test core functionalities
   - Support running tests using make test command
   - Test coverage should include initialization, food generation, collision detection, and movement functions

6. **CI/CD Requirements**:
   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated building
   - Support Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms
   - Support x86_64 and arm64 architectures
   - Automatically run CMake and Makefile builds
   - Implement automatic packaging and release of build artifacts

## Technology Stack

- Language: C
- Library: ncurses
- Build Tool: CMake
- Testing: Custom test framework
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Platforms: Linux, macOS, Windows
- Architectures: x86_64, arm64

```

## Implementation Points

1. **Chinese Support**: Add `setlocale(LC_ALL, "")` before initializing ncurses
2. **Snake Head and Body Distinction**: Use different characters for snake head and body (like @ and O)
3. **Movement Speed Balance**: Adjust vertical movement delay to balance visual speed
4. **Random Seed Management**: Place `srand` call in the initialization function to avoid duplicate seeds
5. **Memory Management**: Ensure proper memory allocation and deallocation when the snake moves
6. **Test Design**: Design independent test cases for core functionalities
7. **Build Configuration**: Ensure correct file paths generated by CMake

## Compilation and Running

### Linux/macOS x86_64/arm64

```bash
# Build with CMake
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run the game
../bin/snake
```

### Windows

```bash
# Build with CMake
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

# Run the game
../bin/snake.exe
```
